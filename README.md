# PWC_Question
To run this code need to follow the following steps:
step 1-> Open the visual studio and in Solution Explorer click on Show all files
         Right Click on Folder PWC_Question and click on Build

Step 2-> go to bin > debug > net6.0  and right click on net6.0. One window will open and need to click on Open in Terminal

Step 3-> Below of the screen you can see one window will open with name Developer Powershell
         Here we need to type ".\PWC_Question.exe Kolkata" and hit enter
         Currently I deal with only few cities. you can write other City name instead of Kolkata like Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai.


Step 4-> You can see the result in the same window with all weather related details.

Step 5-> You have to build that project every time if you change anything in the code
